        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is my new website which is hosted on GitHub Pages! testing</p>
        [SPEAKER_03]: Click here in back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just click on the profile, sign up the account.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is for your name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you might need to create a new account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the tables are already designed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the one that I was talking about is quite easy to come up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different types are already designed by G.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the one that you see is the UI Issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to go through the UI...
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so most of it, the ones that they already fake is the buttons.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one already disappeared, the UI Issue is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disappearing means you don't need to click the Cancel button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you can just click on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Louis, when you tested it without the Cancel button and with the Cancel button,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is easier for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is more intuitive for me, I think, is the window is pop-up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clicking behind one is more interesting compared to...
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need a Cancel button to tell you to cancel some?
[SPEAKER_00]: Important to get gently internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old school, like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, hopefully, the people that use our system is not that young either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to wait for the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: The showstopper one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a showstopper, because actually...
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the major one is the 8-hour timestamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, Fatim is currently fixing it, because of the time zone issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what happens is, whenever we create a ticket, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever we create a ticket...
[SPEAKER_03]: It appears directly, automatically 8 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus 8 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because you sign up based on your time zone, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's because our database is stored in fallen time, so they cannot convert it to UTC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought, when you sign up the time you select your time zone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clicked 8 hours ago, but...
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the current time and also the ticket creator time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I already converted it based on your time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in other words, if I say I'm in Thailand, so my time zone would be 1 hour before, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow the time zone, then this would be whatever the time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't follow the server time, you follow the registration time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This 8-hour thing, it affects a few places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the issue is related to this 8-hour file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: As an admin, when I sign up, that's where I set my...
[SPEAKER_00]: Country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my country, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I add a new user, do you set country as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: New user, it depends on the tenant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you set up your tenant, that's where you detect the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an add-on user, there's no country setting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you follow that tenant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one is, this one also...
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis noticed this because we actually never touched the SLA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we never really touched on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous test we did is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we noticed is, one...
